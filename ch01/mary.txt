Mary had a little lamb,
His fleece was white as snow,
It made the children laugh and play
And everywhere that Mary went,
The lamb was sure to go.
He followed her to school one day,
Which was against the rule,
It made the children laugh and play
He followed her to school one day,
To see a lamb at school.
And so the teacher turned it out,
But still it lingered near,
And waited patiently about,
Till Mary did appear.
He followed her to school one day,
"Why does the lamb love Mary so?"
The eager children cry.
And waited patiently about,
"Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know."
The teacher did reply.
